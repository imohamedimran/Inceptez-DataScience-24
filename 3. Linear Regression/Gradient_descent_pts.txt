Given an equation, what is the value of X where Y is minimum?

Differentiation tells in which direction I should move to find the minimum value.

To achieve the lowest point in the mountain, we need 
1. Direction
2. Momentum (step)

When we try to differentiate (at a point) where y is minimal, the differentiation will be almost zero. Meaning, it cannot move further in any direction.
